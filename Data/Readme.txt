# Super-enhancer interactomes from single-cells link clustering and transcription

The data files are too large to be made directly available at Github and have been deposited at Zenodo. 

Software for processing the data is available in the associated github repository:  https://github.com/BoettigerLab/SEclustering-2024

Additional information can be found in the associated manuscript, currently in preparation -- once it is posted on BioRxiv, it will be linked here. 

This deposition currently includes
1) ChrTableHyb_mm10.csv - a master data table linking the genomic sequence barcode data from the corrected tables (described below) to the corresponding super-enhancer and their genomic coordinates in mm10.
2) Corrected_Data_Tables_by_FOV.zip -- contains drift corrected and chromatically corrected x,y,z coordinates and cellular barcode data to track cell type and coordinate barcode data to identify genomic sequences. 
3) Processed_Seq_Data.zip -- re-processed sequencing based data used in this study.
4) Precomputed_Analysis_Files.zip -- a collection of pre-computed data structures, used by the analysis scripts in our repository. These can be generated from the above image data and sequence data but are presented as processed, pre-computed files to save time.
